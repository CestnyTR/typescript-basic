üöÄ TypeScript Fundamentals: A Practical Project
This project is a comprehensive, beginner-level TypeScript repository created to solidify my understanding of the "TypeScript Fundamentals" learned from an Angular course. It aims to explore the powerful advantages TypeScript offers over JavaScript through hands-on code examples.

üí° Project Goal and Philosophy
This repository is designed to showcase not just theoretical knowledge, but also how TypeScript works in real-world scenarios. It is an ideal resource for anyone who wants to learn how to build more reliable, maintainable, and scalable applications by leveraging TypeScript's ability to catch errors during the compilation phase. This project provides concrete examples that demonstrate why a developer should choose TypeScript.

üìö Covered Topics
Each topic is supported by clear and easy-to-follow code snippets.

Introduction to TypeScript: What is TypeScript and its role in modern web development.

Variable Types: From basic types like string, number, and boolean to more advanced types like array, tuple, and enum.

Functions and Classes: Ensuring type safety in functions and applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Inheritance & Interfaces: Methods to reduce code duplication and create a flexible, structured code architecture.

Generics: The power of generics for writing versatile and type-safe components.

Modules: Organizing and managing code in large-scale projects.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
