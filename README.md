This project is a beginner-level TypeScript learning repository created to reinforce the knowledge gained from the "TypeScript Fundamentals" section of an Angular course. It aims to provide practical examples to help understand the advantages and core features that TypeScript offers over JavaScript.

Key Topics Covered:

Introduction to TypeScript: What TypeScript is and why it should be used.

Variable Types: Defining basic and advanced variable types with type safety.

Functions and Classes: Implementing type-safe functions and applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Inheritance & Interfaces: Methods for reducing code duplication and making the project more structured.

Generics: Making code more flexible and type-safe.

Modules: Organizing code in a modular structure within TypeScript.

Project's Goal:

This repository contains small code snippets that demonstrate TypeScript's working logic, its compilation process, and how it runs in the browser. The main goal is to provide hands-on practice in writing more reliable and maintainable code by leveraging TypeScript's ability to catch errors before compilation. This project is designed to help a developer clearly see the advantages that TypeScript provides.

How to Use:

Clone the repository.

Examine the code in separate files for each lesson topic.

Use the tsc <file_name.ts> command to see how TypeScript compiles.

Run the compiled JavaScript files in your browser to observe the output.
